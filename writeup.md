# Planner App â€“ Your Custom Widget

With Planner App, this would allow us to plan our work, prioritize our goals and see our progress over time.

I believe in the power of holistic planning and recognizing the importance of emotional well-being. That's why I'm developing a custom-made widget, the **Mood Tracker**, to enrich planning journey.

Why the Mood Tracker Widget is Appropriate for the Planner App:

1. Comprehensive Self-Care: The Planner App aims to provide a comprehensive solution for organizing tasks, events, and now, emotions. By integrating the Mood Tracker, we acknowledge that emotional well-being is an integral part of effective planning and productivity.
2. Emotional Awareness: The Mood Tracker fosters emotional awareness by allowing users to track and reflect on their moods. It encourages self-reflection, helps users identify patterns, and promotes a better understanding of their emotional states.
3. Work-Life Balance: Balancing work and personal life is crucial for overall well-being. The Mood Tracker widget in the Planner App enables users to prioritize self-care, manage stress levels, and maintain a healthy work-life balance by considering their emotions alongside their tasks and events.
